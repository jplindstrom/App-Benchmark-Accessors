# NAME

App::Benchmark::Accessors - Benchmark accessor generators

# DESCRIPTION

This distribution runs benchmarks on various accessor generators. The
following generators are being benchmarked:

- Moose

    mutable and immutable

- Mouse

    mutable and immutable

- Moo

    Note: with Moose loaded

- Class::Accessor
- Class::Accessor::Fast
- Class::Accessor::Fast::XS
- Class::XSAccessor::Compat
- Class::Accessor::Complex
- Class::Accessor::Constructor
- Class::Accessor::Classy
- Class::Accessor::Lite
- Mojo::Base
- Class::MethodMaker
- Object::Tiny
- Spiffy
- Class::Spiffy
- `accessors`
- Class::XSAccessor
- Class::XSAccessor::Array
- Object::Tiny
- Rose
- Rubyish::Attribute

The benchmarks are being run as part of the test suite; see [App::Benchmark](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::Benchmark).
This way you can look at this distribution's CPAN testers page to see the
benchmark results on many different platforms and for many different perl
versions.

The `t/construction.t` file benchmarks object creation, `t/get.t` benchmarks
getter methods and `t/set.t` benchmarks setter methods.

Not every benchmark is run on every module; for example, [Object::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Tiny)
doesn't create setter methods, and [accessors](https://metacpan.org/pod/accessors) doesn't generate constructors.

Each benchmark test file takes an optional numeric parameter that is used as
the number of iterations.

It's probably a good idea not to read too much into these benchmarks; they
could be seen as micro-optimization. However, if you have a complex object
hierarchy and create lots of objects and run many many getters/setters on
them, they could help to save some time. But be sure to use [Devel::NYTProf](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::NYTProf)
first to see where your real bottlenecks are.
